    "### Extracellular Potential modeling in large networks\n",
    "\n",
    "JNeuron is able to quickly calculate extracellular potentials from a single neuron by solving the cable equation to find the spatially distributed current along a neuron, then finding the relationship between these currents and voltage at a point in extracellular space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Realistic extracellular potentials are not generated by a single neuron, but tens of thousands of nearby neurons, all superimposed. Therefore, many neurons will need to be used to find realistic voltage signals. Datasets that model these phenomena usually do not contain thousands of different neurons; instead they have several template neurons, and modify the shapes to make each neuron unique. Then the potenials can be found that are generated from this population of randomly permutaed neurons. In this process, solving the cable equations is much more computationally expensive than finding the extracellular potentials. \n",
    "\n",
    "If all of the neurons are modified such that they maintain the same branching architecture, the cable equation that governs the spatial distribution of current is the same; what varies is the coefficients relating the time varying currents at each node and the voltage at some point in extracellular space. JNeuron can take advantage of this design by solving the cable equation only once to get the current vs time profile at each node during an action potential, then using the extracellular cofficients of each neuron to generate the extracellular waveform shape of each neuron. Then a realistic voltage signal is created by generating tens of thousands of spike trains, and replacing each spike with the appropriate extracellular voltage."
