Cable Theory
-------------

The spatial and temporal distribution of voltage along a neuron can be represented by the following partial differential equation:

.. math:: C \frac{\partial{V}}{\partial{t}} = \frac{a}{2R}\frac{\partial^2{V}}{\partial{x^2}} - i_m(V)

Where :math:`C` is the Capacitance of the membrane, :math:`V` is the membrane voltage, :math:`a` is the area of the neuron, :math:`R` is the resistance, and :math:`i_m(V)` is the membrane current from either active (ion channels) or passive processes.
