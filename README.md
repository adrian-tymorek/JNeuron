# JNeuron
Simple single neuron simulations in Julia

## Documentation:
http://jneuron.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

## Overview

This is a toolbox for detailed multicompartmental neuronal models, and related calculations such as extracellular potentials and network activity. Currently, this can import 3D neurolucida files, spatially discritize these models, insert several kinds of ion channels, and find intracellular voltages along the neuron. More functionality and documentation to come.

## TODO

### File Import and Parsers
* SWC import
* MorphML import
* Hoc to Julia
* Mod to Julia

### Extracellular Potentials
* Line source
* Point source

### Computation
* synapses
* Variable Time Step
